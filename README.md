# Nano-Processor
This repository contains the complete design and implementation of a NanoProcessor created using VHDL. The project includes a fully functional register bank, decoder, and additional components required for a basic processor. The primary focus is on modularity, simplicity, and demonstrating the core concepts of digital design.

A complete implementation of a 4-bit NanoProcessor capable of executing a set of predefined instructions. This project includes:

Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU): Performs both arithmetic and logical operations.
Instruction Decoder: Decodes and executes instructions from a defined instruction set.
Extended Register Bank: Supports 16 registers for handling more complex operations.
Program ROM: Stores assembly programs for execution.
Bus and Multiplexer Systems: Efficient data flow and selection mechanisms.
Simulation and Testing: Verified functionality on BASYS 3 development boards with real-world demonstrations.
This repository provides all necessary VHDL code, simulation files,
